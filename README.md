# Adaptive-Infinity-JS-Slider
My simple Adaptive Infinity JS Slider for websites :)

This is a fairly simple, but adaptive and infinity slider on pure JS, without using third-party libraries.

The slider does not support swipes. I didn't do that in this version.

It is not a slider factory function.
it can be easily modified so that it does not depend on the number of slides or accepts an array of parameters as input. This can be easily done 

Elements of backgrounds and pictures were developed in Adobe Illustrator.
